Index-Time vs Query-Time Analysis
=================================

Elasticsearch is a two-phase system:
    Phase 1 — Index-Time (Write Path)
        This happens when a document is stored.
        “How should this text be broken down and stored so it can be found later?”
        Once stored, tokens cannot be changed without reindexing.
    Phase 2 — Query-Time (Read Path)
        This happens when you search.
        “How should my search text be broken down so it matches what was stored?”
        You can change how queries are analyzed anytime
    The Golden Rule
        If tokens don’t match between index-time and query-time → no results
        If the analyzer is not specified at query time, the field’s index-time analyzer is used by default.
